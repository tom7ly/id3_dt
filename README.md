# id3_dt
**The project isn't documented and is definetly not polished**
**It is also my first every project written in Python during my BSc**

Academy project in AI Course.
This is a full implementation of an ID3 Decicsion Tree, and KNN Forest without any external libraries.
It contains various improvements aswell.

The project can be run from ID3.py with commenting/uncommenting the right sections.
It is not ideal but that's the way it was required to be submitted in the project guidelines.

In decicsion_tree.py you can find the better part of the algorithm, including the data structure used, the calculation of attribute theresholds, probabilities and entropy calculations
and the code that processes the data before training.
You will also find the KFold improvements and other experiments I've done with the algorithm.
